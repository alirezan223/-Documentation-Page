                <h3>Instagram</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Instagram (also known as IG) is a photo and video-sharing social networking service owned by
                Facebook, Inc. It was created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, and launched in October 2010
                exclusively on iOS. A version for Android devices was released a year and 6 months later, in April
                2012, followed by a feature-limited website interface in November 2012, and apps for Windows 10 Mobile
                and Windows 10 in April 2016 and October 2016 respectively.
            </p>
            <p>The app allows users to upload photos and videos to the service, which can be edited with various
                filters, and organized with tags and location information. An account's posts can be shared publicly or
                with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations, and view
                trending content. Users can "like" photos, and follow other users to add their content to a feed.

                <h3>History</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Instagram began development in San Francisco, when Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger chose to focus their
                multi-featured HTML5 check-in project, Burbn, on mobile photography. As Krieger reasoned, Burbn became
                too similar to Foursquare, and both realized that it had gone too far. Burbn was then pivoted to become
                more focused on photo-sharing. The word Instagram is a portmanteau of instant camera and
                telegram.</p>
            <p>On March 5, 2010, Systrom closed a $500,000 seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and Andreessen
                Horowitz while working on Burbn.[12] Josh Riedel joined the company in October as Community
                Manager,[13] Shayne Sweeney joined in November as an engineer,[13] and Jessica Zollman joined as a
                Community Evangelist in August 2011.</p>

            <p>
                Kevin Systrom posted the first photo to Instagram on July 16, 2010.[15][16] The photo shows a dog in
                Mexico and Systrom's girlfriend's foot; the photo has been enhanced using Instagram's X-PRO2 filter.
            </p>

            <p>
                On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was officially released through the App Store.
            </p>

            <p>
                In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram had raised $7 million in Series A funding from a
                variety of investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and
                Adam D'Angelo. The deal valued Instagram at around $20 million.
            </p>

            <p>
                On April 3, 2012, Instagram was released for Android phones, and it was downloaded more than
                one million times in less than one day.

                <h3>Features and tools</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Users can upload photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, and geotag images with the
                name of a location. Users can set their account as "private", thereby requiring that they approve any
                new follower requests. Users can connect their Instagram account to other social networking sites,
                enabling them to share uploaded photos to those sites. In January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags
                to help users discover both photos and each other. </p>
            <p> Instagram encourages users to make tags both
                specific and relevant, rather than tagging generic words like "photo", to make photographs stand out
                and to attract like-minded Instagram users. In September 2011, a new version of the app included new
                and live filters, instant tiltâ€“shift, high-resolution photographs, optional borders, one-click
                rotation, and an updated icon. In August 2015, Instagram started allowing users to upload full-size
                landscape and portrait photos and videos onto the service, dropping the previous requirement of a
                square frame.</p> In August 2016, Instagram added a zoom feature that allows users to pinch-to-zoom the
            screen to virtually zoom in on photos and videos. In September 2016, Instagram removed Photo Maps,
            which previously allowed users to see a map of their geotagged photos. An Instagram spokesperson stated
            that "Photo Map was not widely used, so we've decided to remove the feature and focus on other
            priorities". In December 2016, Instagram introduced a feature letting users save photos for later
            viewing. Bookmarked posts get added to a private page in the app. The feature was updated in April 2017
            to let users organize saved posts into different collections.</p>
            <p>In February 2017, Instagram announced that users would be able to upload up to ten pictures or videos to
                one post, with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel. The feature originally limited photos to
                the square format, but received an update in August to enable portrait and landscape photos instead. In
                May, Instagram updated its mobile website to allow users to upload photos, and to add a "lightweight"
                version of the Explore tab. Later in May, Instagram added an "Archive" feature, letting users hide
                posts in a private storage area, out of visibility for the public and other users. The move was seen as
                a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don't garner a desired number of "likes" or are deemed
                boring, but also as a way to limit the "emergent behavior" of deleting photos, which deprives the
                service of content. In August, Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into
                threads, letting users more easily interact with replies. In April 2018, Instagram launched its version
                of a portrait mode called "focus mode," which gently blurs the background of a photo or video while
                keeping the subject in focus when selected.

                <h3>Explore</h3>
            </header>
            <p>In June 2012, Instagram introduced "Explore", a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, photos
                taken at nearby locations, and search. The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending tags and
                places, curated content, and the ability to search for locations. In April 2016, Instagram added a
                "Videos You Might Like" channel to the tab, followed by an "Events" channel in August, featuring videos
                from concerts, sports games, and other live events, followed by the addition of Instagram Stories in
                October. The tab was later expanded again in November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display an
                algorithmically-curated page of the "best" Instagram Live videos currently airing. In May 2017,
                Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to promote public Stories content from nearby places.</p>
